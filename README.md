# Connect-3 Game with AI Player

This is a homework assignment from my CSC 302 (Artificial Intelligence) course at Adelphi University. In this assignment, I implemented an AI opponent using the MiniMax algorithm.

## How to Play
If you'd like to play, install numpy and pygame:
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pygame
```
Run the `connect3.py` file to play the game.
